# Problem:8.14 Boolean Evaluation: Given a boolean expression consisting of the symbols 0 (false), 1 (true), &
# (AND), I (OR), and ^ (XOR), and a desired boolean result value result, implement a function to
# count the number of ways of parenthesizing the expression such that it evaluates to result.
# EXAMPLE
# countEval("1^0|0|1", false) -> 2
# countEval("0&0&0&1^l|0", true) -> 10
def count_boolean_eval(exp, result, cache_dict={}):
    '''
    Algorithm:
    Base Case: If length of string is 1 and result is True then 1 possible way, string is 1 and result is False then 0 ways.
    Higher Case: Split the string on each possible place and count the number of ways for evaluation.
        Ex: 1&1&1 will have 2 places to try expressions in bracket [position 1 and position 3]
    We will evaluate the ways for each position and count them to get the total possible ways.
    How to evaluate the operation ways:
        We will end up like following: left operator right, result
    We need to come up with 3 results: total_ways, total_true and total_false (total_ways - total_true)
        total_ways = (left_true + left_false) * (right_true + right_false)
        total_true (if operator is &): left_true * right_true
        total_true (if operator is ^): (left_true * right_false) + (left_right * right_false)
        similarly for |.
    In the end, we can implement memoization by saving the result of (exp, result) combination in a dictionary.
